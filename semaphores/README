The Semaphore is used to lock the critical section in this program.

The Critical section is when the value of the shared memory is being writen (possibly by different programs)

For the producer file, the critical section is when we want to add an item on the shelf (increment int integer stored in shared memory)


For the consumer file, the critical section is when we want to remove an item on the shelf (increment int integer stored in shared memory)

The semaphore is locked before any process enters any of these sections and is removed (unlocked) after that respective process leave the section

At the end the semaphore is deleted

There is a small chance of deallock happening here as I was not able to effectivily program about it (given the time and sophistication of the issue as presented)

To run both programs type 'make' to create them

To run the producer program simply type 'producer'
To run the consumer program simply type 'consumer'

Then follow the commands provided by the program to use it

Thank you

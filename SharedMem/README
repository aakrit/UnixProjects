To run both programs type 'make' to create them

To run the producer program simply type 'producer'
	you can type a key for the shared memory as argv[1]
		this should match the key for the consumer
	if you don't type one a default used will be provided
To run the consumer program simply type 'consumer'
	you can type a key for the shared memory as argv[1]
		this should match the key for the producer
	if you don't type one a default used will be provided

Then follow the commands provided by the program to use it

Thank you
